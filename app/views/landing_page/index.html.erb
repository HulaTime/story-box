<h1>Story Box</h1>

<h3> Overview </h3>
	<p>
		This project is targeted at Journalists and Media Outlets. It's purpose is to create a single, easy to navigate space where users can save their preferences to display custom news feeds from multiple outlets on a homepage. As a writer the user can create and save articles or notes to their profile for convenience. These articles can be searched, browsed and reviewed by all other users for feedback, unless the writer gives the article private status(to keep their ideas secret!), or commercial status(so that registered media outlets can see them). Media Outlets can search for articles or writers by topic if they need to commission a story or to find new talent.
